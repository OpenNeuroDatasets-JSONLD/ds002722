VA1	UserReport	microV	good	A user report of their current felt valence. This ranges from 0-9; 0 indicates low valence, 9 indicates high valence, 4.5 indicates the neutral position. Ratings were supplied continuously during the experiment via the FEELTRACE interface.
VA2	UserReport	microV	good	A user report of their current felt arousal. This ranges from 0-9; 0 indicates low arousal, 9 indicates high arousal, 4.5 indicates the neutral position. Ratings were supplied continuously during the experiment via the FEELTRACE interface.
VAtarg	MetaData	microV	good	The affective state targetted by the music played to the participant. This ranges from 0-9: 1 indicates low valence, low arousal; 2 = neutral valence, low arousal; 3 = high valence, low arousal; 4 = low valence, neutral arousal; 5 = neutral valence, neutral arousal; 6 = high valence, neutral arousal; 7 = low valence, high arousal; 8 = neutral valence, high arousal; 9 = high valence, high arousal;
